#|Exercise 15. Define ==>. The function consumes two Boolean values, call them sunny and friday.
Its answer is #true if sunny is false or friday is true. Note Logicians call this Boolean operation implication,
and they use the notation sunny => friday for this purpose.|#

;; ==>
(define (==> sunny friday)
  (or (not sunny) friday))

(define sunny #false)
(define friday #true)

;; Test with known result
(or (not sunny) friday) ; #true
