#|Exercise 27. Our solution to the sample problem contains several constants in the middle of functions.
As One Program, Many Definitions already points out, it is best to give names to such constants so that
future readers understand where these numbers come from. Collect all definitions in DrRacketâ€™s definitions
area and change them so that all magic numbers are refactored into constant definitions.
