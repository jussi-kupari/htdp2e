#|Exercise 7. Boolean expressions can express some everyday problems.
Suppose you want to decide whether today is an appropriate day to go to the mall.
You go to the mall either if it is not sunny or today is Friday (because that is when stores post new sales items).

Here is how you could go about it using your new knowledge about Booleans.
First add these two lines to the definitions area of DrRacket:

    (define sunny #true)
    (define friday #false)

Now create an expression that computes whether sunny is false or friday is true.
So in this particular case, the answer is #false. (Why?)|#

(define sunny #true)
(define friday #false)

;; Is it not sunny or Friday?
(or (not sunny) friday)

;; Individual evaluation steps
(or (not sunny) friday) 
(or (not #true) friday) 
(or #false friday) 
(or #false #false)
#false
