#|Exercise 33. Research the “year 2000” problem.|#

#|I asked Claude AI to give a 250 word summary

"Here is a 247-word summary of the "year 2000" or "Y2K" problem:

The year 2000 problem, also known as the Y2K problem, referred
to issues that were anticipated to occur with computer systems
and software when the year changed from 1999 to 2000. This was
a result of many early computer systems and programs only using
the last 2 digits to represent the year in dates, such as "99"
instead of "1999," in order to save on data storage space. When
the year changed to 2000, systems with this 2-digit date
representation would interpret "00" as the year 1900 instead of
2000, leading to errors in date/time calculations or functionality
failure. Remediation efforts began years ahead to prevent major
disruptions by updating computer hardware and software code to
properly handle 4-digit year representations. While some feared
catastrophic technology issues such as critical infrastructure
failure when the year 2000 arrived, in reality only minor disruptions
occurred, largely due to the extensive preventative work. Some companies
and organizations reportedly spent hugely - estimates ran as high
as a total $300-600 billion worldwide - to fix and test systems to
ensure continuity into 2000 and beyond. The realization that proactive
remediation was needed to avert a potential crisis ultimately led many
companies and industries to take date/time handling more seriously
in system designs."|#
