#|Exercise 12. Define the function cvolume, which accepts the length of a side of an equilateral cube and computes its volume.
If you have time, consider defining csurface, too.

Hint: An equilateral cube is a three-dimensional container bounded by six squares.
You can determine the surface of a cube if you know that the squareâ€™s area is its length multiplied by itself.
Its volume is the length multiplied with the area of one of its squares. (Why?)|#

;; cvolume
(define (cvolume x)
  (expt x 3))

;; Test with known results 
(cvolume 10) ; => 1000
(cvolume  1) ; =>    1

;; csurface
(define (csurface x)
  (* (sqr x) 6))

(csurface 10) ; => 600
